# Implementation diary

## 2026-02-28 00:44 - Ticket bootstrap already in place

Ticket and initial design/task docs existed before implementation start in this session.

## 2026-02-28 00:49 - Phase 1 attempt (engine-local ARC bridge)

Actions performed in `go-go-os`:

1. Added engine-local ARC bridge contracts/slice/selectors and tests.
2. Exported ARC bridge from engine index.

Validation:

1. `npx vitest run packages/engine/src/__tests__/arc-bridge-slice.test.ts` passed (5 tests).

Commit:

1. `d0fb9e0` - `feat(engine): add ARC bridge command state contracts and reducers`

## 2026-02-28 00:55 - Boundary conflict discovered

While implementing middleware, requirement clarification arrived: ARC domain logic should move to `go-go-app-arc-agi-3`.

Decision:

1. keep `go-go-os` generic,
2. move ARC bridge domain implementation out of engine.

## 2026-02-28 00:56 - Engine cleanup for clean boundary

Actions performed in `go-go-os`:

1. Removed engine-local ARC bridge files (`features/arcBridge/*`, ARC bridge tests).
2. Kept generic runtime metadata propagation in `pluginIntentRouting.ts` by including `runtimeSessionId` and `windowId` on downstream domain actions.
3. Updated routing test to assert canonical domain action emission + correlation metadata.

Validation:

1. `npx vitest run packages/engine/src/__tests__/plugin-intent-routing.test.ts` passed (3 tests).

Commit:

1. `ea01413` - `refactor(engine): keep runtime generic for arc app boundary`

## 2026-02-28 01:00 - ARC bridge implemented in ARC app repo

Actions performed in `go-go-app-arc-agi-3`:

1. Added `apps/arc-agi-player/src/bridge/`:
   - `contracts.ts`
   - `slice.ts`
   - `selectors.ts`
   - `middleware.ts`
   - `index.ts`
2. Wired bridge reducer + middleware into `apps/arc-agi-player/src/app/store.ts`.
3. Added HyperCard demo stack files:
   - `domain/pluginBundle.ts`
   - `domain/stack.ts`
4. Updated launcher module to open a folder window from icon click with two actions:
   - open current React game,
   - open HyperCard demo stack.
5. Kept game window adapter support.

Implementation note:

1. Middleware mirrors command status and key ARC identifiers back into runtime `sessionState` via `ingestRuntimeIntent(scope='session', actionType='patch', ...)` so cards can reflect progress/state.

Commit:

1. `69755fb` - `feat(arc-agi-player): add local ARC bridge and folder-based demo stack launcher`

## 2026-02-28 01:02 - Validation run

Validation command:

1. `npm run test -w apps/os-launcher -- launcherHost` (run in `wesen-os`) -> passed (17 tests).

Notes:

1. Direct standalone typecheck in `go-go-app-arc-agi-3` emits many pre-existing workspace and dependency-path errors unrelated to this change; not used as gating signal in this workspace topology.

## Remaining work

1. Add ARC bridge middleware unit tests in ARC repo (mocked fetch success/failure/denied/dedupe).
2. Manual smoke validation from UI:
   - icon opens folder,
   - folder opens React game,
   - folder opens HyperCard demo,
   - demo dispatches create-session/action/reset end-to-end.
3. Add final changelog closure entry once manual smoke evidence is collected.

## 2026-02-28 01:14 - Runtime render warning + empty card output hotfix

Bug report received:

1. React warning: `Cannot update a component (DesktopShell) while rendering a different component (PluginCardSessionHost)`.
2. ARC demo card window showed `No plugin output for card: home` with runtime session alive.

Root cause analysis:

1. ARC demo bundle `home.render` accessed `command.status` when `command` was `null` on first render (no request yet), causing a render exception.
2. `PluginCardSessionHost` caught render exceptions and dispatched `showToast(...)` inside `useMemo` render computation, which is a state update during render and triggers React warning.

Fixes applied:

1. `go-go-app-arc-agi-3` commit `c0b8e3f`:
   - `latestCommand` now returns `{}` for empty request id.
   - `home.render` uses `asRecord(latestCommand(...))` before status access.
2. `go-go-os` commit `b645bea`:
   - `PluginCardSessionHost` render path now returns `{ tree, error }` from memo.
   - toast dispatch for render errors moved to `useEffect` with dedupe ref.
   - host shows explicit `Runtime render error: ...` fallback instead of silent `No plugin output`.

Validation:

1. `npx vitest run packages/engine/src/__tests__/plugin-intent-routing.test.ts` -> pass.
2. `npm run test -w apps/os-launcher -- launcherHost` -> pass.

## 2026-02-28 01:24 - Create-session stuck at requested (no HTTP) fix

Bug report received:

1. Runtime card `Create Session` set `requestId`/`status=requested` in card state.
2. Redux showed `ingestRuntimeIntent` and downstream `arc/command.request`.
3. No network request followed.

Root cause:

1. ARC command middleware runs in ARC app-local store (`ArcPlayerHost`) only.
2. HyperCard demo card windows run in launcher/global store path.
3. Launcher path was dispatching intents but had no ARC command side-effect runner attached.

Fix applied (`go-go-app-arc-agi-3`):

1. Added `ArcPendingIntentEffectHost` which:
   - reads `pluginCardRuntime.pendingDomainIntents`,
   - filters `domain=arc` + `actionType=command.request`,
   - dequeues each processed intent,
   - executes HTTP requests against `/api/apps/arc-agi/*`,
   - mirrors status/result back into runtime session state via `ingestRuntimeIntent(session.patch)`.
2. Mounted `ArcPendingIntentEffectHost` in ARC demo card adapter next to `PluginCardSessionHost` in launcher module.

Validation:

1. `npm run test -w apps/os-launcher -- launcherHost` -> pass (17 tests).
2. `npm run build -w apps/os-launcher` -> pass.

Commit:

1. `4610f75` - `fix(arc): execute queued card intents in launcher card windows`

## 2026-02-28 01:31 - Session created but action/reset still blocked

Bug report received:

1. `Create Session` now succeeds and `session_id` is visible.
2. Action/reset buttons still report precondition failure.

Root cause:

1. `create-session` response returns `session_id` only (no `game_id`), which is expected for current backend routes.
2. Runtime success patch wrote `arcGameId: undefined`, because patch payload always included `arcGameId` key.
3. `patch` action uses `Object.assign`, so `undefined` overwrote previously selected game id.
4. Card guards required both `sessionId` and `gameId`, so reset/action paths stayed blocked.

Fixes applied (`go-go-app-arc-agi-3`):

1. Added conditional runtime success patch builders in both:
   - `bridge/ArcPendingIntentEffectHost.tsx`
   - `bridge/middleware.ts`
   so `arcGameId`/`arcSessionId` are only patched when defined.
2. Updated demo card UX in `domain/pluginBundle.ts`:
   - added editable `Game ID` input,
   - added quick-select buttons (`bt11`, `vc33`, `ft09`, `ls20`),
   - defaulted initial `arcGameId` to `bt11`,
   - improved precondition toasts to distinguish missing session vs missing game id.

Validation:

1. `npm run test -w apps/os-launcher -- launcherHost` -> pass (17 tests).
2. `npm run build -w apps/os-launcher` -> pass.

Commit:

1. `5da5329` - `fix(arc-demo): preserve game id and add card game picker`

## 2026-02-28 01:35 - Dynamic game list requirement (no hardcoded IDs)

Requirement update:

1. Game IDs must be discovered dynamically from backend (`/api/apps/arc-agi/games`), not hardcoded in card UI.

Implementation:

1. Added new ARC runtime command op: `list-games`.
2. Added bridge execution mapping for `list-games` in both execution paths:
   - `ArcPendingIntentEffectHost` (launcher-store card windows),
   - `createArcBridgeMiddleware` (app-local store path).
3. Added runtime success patch support to persist discovered IDs as `arcAvailableGames` in card `sessionState`.
4. Updated demo card:
   - new `Load Games` button dispatching `list-games`,
   - dynamic game buttons rendered from `arcAvailableGames`,
   - freeform `Game ID` input retained for explicit override.

Validation:

1. `npm run test -w apps/os-launcher -- launcherHost` -> pass (17 tests).
2. `npm run build -w apps/os-launcher` -> pass.

Commit:

1. `096f8f8` - `feat(arc-demo): load game ids dynamically for card sessions`
