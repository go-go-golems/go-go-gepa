# Phase 2 ARC bridge for HyperCard runtime command execution

## Overview

This ticket operationalizes the Phase 2 ARC bridge architecture from GEPA-14 into a concrete implementation stream. The design doc defines the command contracts, effect execution model, state shape, projection requirements, and acceptance criteria. `tasks.md` breaks execution into granular phases from kickoff and type contracts through integration tests and rollout cleanup.
